## Objectives

Modify the Source SDK in such a way that I might be able to create a long time mod idea I've been carrying around in my head.
For this it's necessary to implement some RPG characteristics into the game engine

## To-Do

* AI relationships
	* Further optimizations (maybe load initially from database?)
	* Change player model (and hands) on change of relationship
	* Add overlay for certain classes (combine/metropolice)
	* Save changed relationship in usual save files
* World
	* Make an easy way to add variables that are updated while exiting a map (eg. number of combine killed, a mini game score, number of items of some sort collected, ...)
* Player
	* Make it possible to select a character in the new game dialog
	* Make the starting map and and difficulty dependent on the selected character
