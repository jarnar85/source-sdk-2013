               Entropy : Zero

This repository contains the code for the modification Entropy : Zero.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/714070/Entropy__Zero/

The manhack weapon was originally created by the Half-Life 2: Short Stories Team for Human Error and modified for Entropy : Zero. All other E:Z code changes were originally made by Breadman AKA John Richardson. They have been adapted with preprocessor directives "EZ" and "EZ1" to prevent conflicts with the original Source SDK 2013 code.

To set up a mod for Entropy : Zero, run the batch script sp/src/createentropyzeroproject.bat. This will use VPC to generate your solution file, entropyzero.sln. (Visual Studio 2013 must be installed to use this project) 

Compiled mod binaries will be placed in game/mod_ez1/bin. To install your E:Z mod, copy mod_ez1 to your Steam/SteamApps/sourcemods directory.
