## Change AI-Relationships

This command needs sv_cheats to be active.
The result will be that you will get the same relationship to all NPCs as the class given as a parameter.
Your allies will get a similar (but not the same) relationship as well.

### COMMAND
player_setclass <CLASS_NAME>

### CLASS_NAME
The class name can be any internal class name used for the relationship table
Here are some examples:
* CLASS_COMBINE
* CLASS_ZOMBIE
* CLASS_CITIZEN_REBEL
* CLASS_MANHACK
